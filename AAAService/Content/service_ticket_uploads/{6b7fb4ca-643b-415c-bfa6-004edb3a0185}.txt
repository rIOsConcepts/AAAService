Here is my thought about email functionality:
We will use SmtpClient class for sending email
Here is a simple example on how to use SmtpClient to send emails, if you search online, would see many examples

using System.Net.Mail;
...
MailMessage mail = new MailMessage("you@yourcompany.com", "user@hotmail.com");
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient();
client.Port = 25;
client.DeliveryMethod = SmtpDeliveryMethod.Network;
client.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
client.Host = "smtp.google.com";
mail.Subject = "this is a test email.";
mail.Body = "this is my test email body";
client.Send(mail);

We can create a table emailSetting in the DB, which contains the template (e.g. email subject, body template, etc.)  for each type of email we need to send, e.g. create a new user, create a new ticket, Status update, etc.
We can create a SendMail class which will take email type and other dynamic information
The SendMail class can query emailSetting and user table based on passed in email type and other dynamic information passed in, replace the placeholder in the template, then send the email


Samples:

This is the email we get (and all connected with this site / and the requestor if they aren’t attached to the site) when the status is completed.  I believe any updates come thru like this, except it would just say IN PROGRESS or DISPATCHED or whatever the status update happens to be…
