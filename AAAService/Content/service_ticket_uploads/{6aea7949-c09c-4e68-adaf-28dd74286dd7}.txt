WIGHTONS WAS JUST ONSITE THIS MORNING DOING THEIR QUARTERLY. THE THERMOSTAT ON THE FIRST FLOOR NEAR THE BREAK ROOM HAS THE WRONG DATE AND TIME. IT CURRENTLY SAYS SUNDAY AT 6 P.M. TODAY IS MONDAY ITS 3:45 P.M. AND ITS 75 DEGREES IN THAT ZONE. I AM NOT SURE I KNOW HOW TO SET THE CORRECT DATE AND TIME AND GET IT TO THE PROPER TEMP. IF ITS SOMETHING THAT I CAN BE WALKED THROUGH HAVE THEM CALL ME. OTHERWISE WE WILL NEED A SERVICE CALL.
